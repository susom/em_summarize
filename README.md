# Summarize

This external module allows you to display summary data from forms and/or fields into a nicely formatted HTML table display.
The summary data is kept as a HTML string in a text or textarea field in the project.  Typically this field is marked as @HIDDEN.
To display the table, you can then 'pipe' this hidden field anywhere in your project, emails, or survey completion pages.

Only fields which contain values will be displayed (e.g. empty fields will be dropped off).

There are a number of options to help streamline the rendering and display of the summary table.


## Options

1. Title (supports HTML and can be used to add custom text above a summary table)
1. Source event_id if longitudinal (all fields/forms must come from the same event_id)
1. Comma-separated list of forms to include
1. Comma-separated list of fields to include
1. Comma-separated list of fields to exclude (optional)
1. Option to exclude all form status values
1. Option to display field value under the field label (default is two column display)
1. Option to specify field label width (in percentage). 
1. Option to specify the maximum length of a field value to display it in the second column.  Once the value is larger than this maximum amount, it will be placed on a second line under the field label.

## Assumptions
1. You always display 'labels' and not titles.
1. We filter HTML tags from labels that might be harmful embedding them into a form
1. You do not need to include fields on an included form - the fields actually summarized are the union of the forms and fields specified (less the excluded fields)

## Valid Configuration Checks

1. The destination field must be of type text or textarea and should not have any validation
1. The destination field must be in the same event as the source fields for classical/longitudinal.  
1. If the source form is repeating, then the destination field must be in the same form.
1. If the source forms/fields are in a repeating event, the destination field must be in that repeating event.
